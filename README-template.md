### What I learned

During this challenge I was getting comfortable with the frontend mentor website and this served as the perfect tutorial for that.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about CSS Grid as I tend to try to solve every problem with Flexbox, and also focus on a mobile-first mindset.
